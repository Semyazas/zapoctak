Client side

We will run client side by running following command in command line "javac path/app.java [portNumber] [host]". Where path is
path to ...

After there will popup window in which we either login or we can registrate. In both case we simply enter
our data and than click "OK".

If we succesfully logged in, terminal window will popup. This is for sending commands to server. 

    Commands:
        - "req [Username]"
            - this command sends chat request to user with specified username (if user exists).

        - "acc [Username]"
            - If specified user send us chat request then 
              this command accepts chat request from user with specified username. This means
              that we will be able to initiate chat session with specified user.

            - If specified user didn't send us chat request,
              than terminal will write "Incorrect usage of acc". At this point we cannot
              initiate chat session with specifed user.

        - "window [Username]"
            - If between us and specified user was send chat request and then was
              this request by its reciever accepted, then this command will open new
              window. This newly opened window serves to chat between us and specified user.
              If we want to send message to specified user we simply enter it into window and
              click "send".
        
        - "hist [Username]"
            - This will send us full chat history between us and specifed user. It will be written on 
              chat window between us and specifed user.

Note: if we close any window, the app will shut down.

Server side

We will run client side by running following command in command line "javac path/app.java [portNumber] [DataPath]". Where path is
path to .... DataPath is path in which we would like to store data. By data I mean "history.txt" which contains every
message that was sent between 2 users in format "sender;reciever;date;time;message"and "data.txt" which stores data about registered users in format "username;password;name;surname".
