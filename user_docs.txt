First we have to compile project that we want to use.

Client side

We will run client side by running following command in command line "java -cp pathToClass zpct.App [portNumber] [host]", where
[portNumber] is number of port and [host] is host and pathToClass is path to class (in maven project target directory).

After there will popup window in which we either login or we can registrate. In both case we simply enter
our data and than click "OK".

If we succesfully logged in, terminal window will popup. This is for sending commands to server. 
    Commands:
        - "req [Username]"
            - This command sends chat request to user with specified username (if user exists). Specified
              user gets this request and his command terminal will write "[OtherUser] req [Username]" 
              where [OtherUser] is username of the one who sent request.
            
            - Example of use. Let's say that we want to send chat request to user Karel and our username is Honza.
                - we write into command terminal "req Karel"

        - "acc [Username]"
            - If specified user send us chat request then 
              this command accepts chat request from user with specified username. This means
              that we will be able to initiate chat session with specified user.

            - If specified user didn't send us chat request,
              than terminal will write "Incorrect usage of acc". At this point we cannot
              initiate chat session with specifed user.

            - Example of use. Let's say that our name is Karel and we recieved from Honza this message (it will be written
              on command terminal) "Honza req Karel".
                - if we write into terminal "acc Honza", then we will be able to initiate chat session with Karel and vice versa.

        - "window [Username]"
            - If between us and specified user was send chat request and then was
              this request by its reciever accepted, then this command will open new
              window. This newly opened window serves to chat between us and specified user.
              If we want to send message to specified user we simply enter it into window and
              click "send".
        
        - "hist [Username]"
            - This will send us full chat history between us and specifed user. It will be written on 
              chat window between us and specifed user.

Note: if we close any window, the app will shut down.

Server side

We will run client side by running following command in command line "java -cp classPath server.ServerApp [portNumber] [DataPath]".
classPath is path to classes.  
[DataPath] is path in which we would like to store data. By data I mean "history.txt" which contains every
message that was sent between 2 users in format "sender;reciever;date;time;message"and "data.txt" 
which stores data about registered users in format "username;password;name;surname".
